🚀 Master Prompt: Seamless Dash (Final v38)
Role: Act as an expert Game Developer specializing in HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript. Objective: Maintain, update, or recreate "Seamless Dash," a high-performance, mobile-responsive web game for the Seamex / Poornata App ecosystem.

1. Core Identity & Branding
Game Title: Seamless Dash.

Brand: Seamex (Powered by Seamex).

Visual Style: Modern, clean HR-tech aesthetic. Use a professional color palette: Red (#A01018), Gold (#FFC107), Sky Blue (#e3f2fd), and Royal Blue (#0984e3).

Trivia: Integrate Seamex/Poornata HR transformation facts on the Game Over screen.

2. Technical Architecture
Engine: HTML5 Canvas (2D Context) with alpha: false for optimization.

State Management: A global STATE object tracking phase (MENU, READY, PLAYING, GAMEOVER), score, level, shield (timer), and shake (intensity).

Persistence: * Save user profile to seamex_user_v38.

Save global leaderboard to seamex_lb_v38.

Save individual high scores per Poornata ID using seamex_hs_[ID].

3. UI/UX Requirements
Responsive Design: Full-screen coverage with auto-resizing. Use a high z-index for UI layers to ensure they vanish during gameplay.

Validation: * Name: Regex /^[A-Za-z\s]{3,}$/ (Letters only, min 3).

Poornata ID: Regex /^[0-9]{4,10}$/ (Numbers only, 4-10 digits).

Game HUD: Show real-time Score, Level, and Best Score. Include a "Start Toast" and a "Shield Timer" countdown.

4. Gameplay Mechanics
Flight Physics: "Hold to Fly" mechanic. Release to end the game immediately (End Dash).

Character: Large character sprite with a bobbing animation and a motion-trail history effect (5-10 frames).

Obstacles (Viruses): * Spawn rate and speed increase per Level (every 100 points).

Level 10+ adds horizontal velocity to enemies.

Shield System: * Spawns randomly after 50 points.

Grants 8 seconds of invulnerability.

On contact with viruses: Destroy virus, trigger yellow particles, and trigger a 10px screen shake.

Environmental Progression: * Level 1-3: Day Sky.

Level 4-6: Sunset.

Level 7+: Night Sky.

Use lerpColor for smooth background transitions.

5. Critical Logic Fixes (Non-Negotiable)
Screen Shake Decay: The decay logic (STATE.shake *= 0.85) must run at the start of the update() loop, outside of any state checks, to prevent permanent vibration bugs when destroying viruses with a shield.

Game Over Reset: On Game Over, the character must hard-stop bobbing (player.bob = 0) and the motion trail must be cleared to prevent visual ghosting.

Z-Index: Ensure the #ui-layer has pointer-events: none but child containers have pointer-events: auto to allow button clicks without blocking game input.
